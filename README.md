Hi. This repo contains the scripts and relevant documentation to reproduce results of giant molecular clouds in the galaxy NGC1387 (Liang et al.), starting from code-summary.txt.

They are meant for reproducibility and not specifically tailored to the standards for distribution nor for new projects. For example, (almost all) file paths are absolute paths on my own machines; some scripts should be run block by block with a moderate degree of manual attention (rather than blindly); and there may be package dependencies not taken care of. Having said that, it would be nice if you find the scripts useful. Feel free to get in touch (ericfuhengliang at gmail). And please cite the paper (Liang+25) in your publication as you see fit.

Data and products are not stored here. They are available at respective public archives (esp. raw data) and the WISDOM data release (https://wisdom-project.org/data/).
